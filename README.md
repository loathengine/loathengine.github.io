##  empfohlenen Vorgehensweise

For a seamless experience, it's best to enter data in a specific order, as some records depend on others. The recommended workflow is:

1.  **Setup Foundational Data (`Misc` Tab):** Add your manufacturers, bullet diameters, and cartridge types first.
2.  **Inventory Components (`Components` Tab):** Log the specific bullets, powders, primers, and brass you own.
3.  **Add Your Firearms (`Firearms` Tab):** Create profiles for each of your firearms.
4.  **Create Load Data (`Loads` Tab):** Define your hand loads or log your commercial ammunition.
5.  **Upload Targets (`Targets` Tab):** Add images of your shot targets.
6.  **Mark Your Shots (`Marking` Tab):** Digitize your groups by marking your point of aim and impacts on the target images.
7.  **Analyze Performance (`Analysis` Tab):** Review detailed statistics, compare sessions, and export your findings.
8.  **Manage Your Data (`DB Management` Tab):** Backup and restore your database as needed.

## 1. Setup: Foundational Data

Before you can track loads or firearms, you need to input the basic building blocks.

### The `Misc` Tab

This is the most important first step.
* **Manufacturers:** Go to the `Manufacturers` sub-tab. Enter the names of manufacturers (e.g., Hornady, Hodgdon, CCI) and check the boxes for the types of products they make. This populates the manufacturer dropdowns in other forms.
* **Diameters:** Go to the `Diameters` sub-tab. Add the bullet diameters you use (e.g., Imperial: `.224`, Metric: `5.56mm`).
* **Cartridges:** Go to the `Cartridges` sub-tab. Add the cartridges you use (e.g., `223 Remington`), selecting the appropriate diameter you just created.

### The `Components` Tab

Here, you'll create a detailed inventory of your reloading components.
* **Bullets:** Select the `Bullets` sub-tab. Enter the bullet's manufacturer, diameter, name, weight, and length.
* **Powder:** Select the `Powder` sub-tab and add your powders, linking them to a manufacturer.
* **Primers:** Select the `Primers` sub-tab and add your primers.
* **Brass:** Select the `Brass` sub-tab. Select a cartridge (which you created in the `Misc` tab) and the manufacturer.

### The `Firearms` Tab

Create a profile for each firearm you own.
1.  Enter a **Nickname** for easy identification.
2.  Select the **Diameter** and **Cartridge**. The cartridge list is filtered by the selected diameter.
3.  Fill in other details like barrel length and twist rate.
4.  Click **Save Firearm**.

## 2. Data Entry

With the setup complete, you can now enter your specific load and target data.

### The `Loads` Tab

You can log both custom hand loads and factory-loaded commercial ammunition.
* **For Hand Loads:**
    1.  Select the `Hand Load` sub-tab.
    2.  Choose the **Diameter** and **Cartridge**. This will filter the dropdowns for bullets and brass, showing only compatible components.
    3.  Select the **Bullet**, **Powder**, **Primer**, and **Brass** from your component inventory.
    4.  Enter the **Charge Weight**, COL (Cartridge Overall Length), CBTO (Cartridge Base to Ogive), and other relevant data.
    5.  Click **Save Hand Load**.
* **For Commercial Ammo:**
    1.  Select the `Commercial Ammo` sub-tab.
    2.  Choose the **Manufacturer**, **Ammo Name**, **Diameter**, and **Cartridge**.
    3.  Enter the bullet weight and lot number if you have it.
    4.  Click **Save Commercial Ammo**.

### The `Targets` Tab

This is where you build your library of target images for analysis.
1.  Click the **"Upload New Target Image(s)"** button and select one or more image files from your device.
2.  The images will be converted to an efficient format, saved, and displayed in the gallery.
3.  You can **Rename** or **Delete** targets directly from the gallery.

## 3. Marking & Analysis (The Core Loop)

This is where your data comes together to produce insights.

### The `Marking` Tab

Here you will digitize your shot groups.
1.  **Load Image:** In the `Setup` panel, select a target from the **Load Saved Image** dropdown. The image will appear on the canvas.
2.  **Set the Scale (Crucial Step):**
    * In the `Image Controls` panel, enter a known distance in the **Scale** input fields (e.g., the 1-inch grid on your target). Select the correct units.
    * Click the **Set Scale** button. It will turn blue.
    * Click two points on the canvas that correspond to the known distance. A red line will appear. The application now knows the real-world size of a pixel on your target image. This is essential for accurate measurements.
3.  **Mark Your Group:**
    * In the `Marking Tools` panel, click **New Group**. A group will be added to the `Active Group` dropdown.
    * Click the **Set POA** (Point of Aim) button.
    * Click on the canvas where you were aiming for this group. A crosshair `+` will appear.
    * The **Mark Impacts** button will automatically become active. Click on the canvas at the center of each bullet hole for that group. Blue dots will appear.
4.  **Enter Session Info:**
    * In the `Session Info` panel, select the **Firearm** and **Load** you used for this session.
    * Enter the **Target Distance** (e.g., 100 yards).
5.  **Save:** Click the **Save / Update Session** button.

*Tip: You can also enter shot velocities in the `Impact Data` section that appears below the canvas.*

### The `Analysis` Tab

This tab provides a deep dive into the performance of a saved session.
1.  **Load Session:** Select a session from the **Load Session from DB** dropdown. The shot data will populate the table and the calculated statistics will appear below.
2.  **Review Statistics:**
    * **Group Statistics:** See your group's Extreme Spread (ES) and Mean Radius.
    * **Dispersion Statistics:** View the Horizontal/Vertical Standard Deviation and, most importantly, the **Radial Standard Deviation (RSD)**â€”a robust measure of your group's precision.
    * **Velocity Statistics:** If you entered velocities, see the ES and SD for your muzzle velocity.
3.  **Compare Sessions (F-Test):**
    * Select another session in the **Compare Against Session** dropdown.
    * The `F-Test for Variance` box will appear, telling you if the difference in precision (variance) between the two groups is statistically significant. This is far more reliable than just comparing two 5-shot group sizes.
4.  **Export:** Click **Export Analysis as PDF** to generate a shareable report with all session info, statistics, and the target image.

## 4. Database Management

The `DB Management` tab gives you full control over your data.

* **Export Entire Database:** Use this to create a full backup of all your data into a single `.json` file. **It is highly recommended to do this regularly.**
* **Import Entire Database:** Restores your application from a backup file. **Warning:** This will overwrite all current data.
* **Delete Entire Database:** Wipes everything. **Use with extreme caution.**
* **Table Specific Actions:** You can also select a single data table (like `bullets` or `firearms`) to view, export, clear, or import data for just that table.
