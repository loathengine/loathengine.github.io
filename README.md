Empirical Precision

### Getting Started: A Step-by-Step Guide

Here is a simple guide to using the Empirical Accuracy tool to analyze your target images.

**1. Add an Image**
* Click the **"Add Image"** button to select a target image from your computer.
* Once loaded, the image will appear in the main canvas area.
* You can add multiple images. Use the **"Current Image"** dropdown to switch between them.
* To remove the currently selected image, click the **"Remove Image"** button.

**2. Set the Scale**
* Before you can get accurate measurements, you must set the scale for the image.
* Click the **"Set Scale"** button. Your cursor will change.
* Click on two points on the image that represent a known distance (e.g., the edges of a 1-inch square on your target).
* The application will use this to calibrate all future measurements.
* You can switch between **Imperial (in)** and **Metric (mm)** units by clicking the "Units" button. You must reset the scale if you change units.

**3. Create a Group**
* All shots are organized into groups.
* Click the **"Create New Group"** button to start a new group.
* You can switch between groups using the **"Current Group"** dropdown.

**4. Mark Your Points**
* **Point of Aim (POA):** Click **"Mark Point of Aim"**. Your cursor will become a crosshair. Click on the image where you were aiming for that group.
* **Points of Impact (POI):** After setting the POA, the tool will automatically switch to marking impacts. Click **"Mark Point of Impact"**, and your cursor will change. Click on each bullet hole for the current group.
* **Delete Last Impact:** If you make a mistake, click **"Delete Last Impact"** to remove the last point you added.

**5. Analyze the Results**
* As you add points, the **"Ballistic Analysis"** box will automatically update with statistics like Extreme Spread (ES), Mean Radius, and more.
* The points will be drawn on the canvas for visual reference.

**6. Combined Analysis**
* If you have multiple images with their scales set, you can toggle the **"Combined Analysis"** switch.
* This will combine the data from all shots across all images to give you a comprehensive performance overview.

**7. Clear Data**
* To start completely fresh, click the **"Clear All Data"** button. **Warning:** This will remove all images and data and cannot be undone.
