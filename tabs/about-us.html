                <h3>Welcome to Empirical Precision</h3>
                <p class="about-us-p">
                    This web application is a comprehensive tool designed for shooting enthusiasts, competitive marksmen, and handloaders. Our goal is to provide a single, powerful platform to manage every aspect of your shooting hobby, from the components on your reloading bench to the final analysis of your performance on the range.
                </p>
                <h4>Key Features:</h4>
                <ul class="about-us-p" style="list-style-position: inside;">
                    <li><strong>Component Management:</strong> Keep a detailed inventory of your reloading components, including bullets, powders, primers, and brass.</li>
                    <li><strong>Load Data Management:</strong> Develop, save, and manage your specific handload recipes and commercial ammunition.</li>
                    <li><strong>Target Management:</strong> Upload images of your targets to create a digital library for analysis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Impact Marking & Analysis:</strong> Digitize your targets by marking points of aim and impact, then instantly calculate critical statistics like Mean Radius and Standard Deviation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advanced Diagnostics:</strong> Automatically analyze shot dispersion to identify issues like vertical stringing and correlate it with muzzle velocity data to pinpoint the root cause.</li>
                </ul>
                 <h4>Recommended Workflow:</h4>
                 <p class="about-us-p">
                    For the best experience, we recommend following this workflow:
                 </p>
                 <ol class="about-us-p" style="list-style-position: inside;">
                    <li><strong>Firearms Tab:</strong> Start by adding the firearms you'll be using.</li>
                    <li><strong>Load Data Tab:</strong> Create your load recipes, linking them to your components.</li>
                    <li><strong>Targets Tab:</strong> Upload images of the paper targets you've shot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Marking Tab:</strong> Select a firearm, load, and target. Then, mark your point-of-aim and impacts on the canvas to save a new session. Enter velocity data for each shot if you have it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Analysis Tab:</strong> Load your saved sessions to view detailed statistics, compare performance against other sessions, and use the diagnostic tools to understand your results.</li>
                 </ol>
                 <h4>A Note on Group Size & Statistical Significance</h4>
                 <p class="about-us-p">
                     When evaluating the precision of a load, it's tempting to rely on small, 3 or 5-shot groups. They are quick to shoot and easy to measure. However, the results from such small sample sizes can often be misleading. A tight 3-shot group might be a statistical fluke rather than a true representation of your load's potential, just as a surprisingly wide group might be the result of a single random flyer.
                 </p>
                 <p class="about-us-p">
                     The power of statistical analysis, and a core principle of this application, lies in using larger data sets. As you increase the number of shots in your sample—from 5 to 10, and ideally to 20 or 30—the calculated metrics like <strong>Mean Radius</strong> become far more reliable. These larger groups smooth out the randomness of individual shots, giving you a much clearer picture of the load's true capabilities.

                 <p class="about-us-p">
                     This becomes critically important when comparing two different loads. Is your new handload <em>really</em> more precise than the old one? Comparing two 5-shot groups might not provide a definitive answer, as the difference you see could easily be due to chance. The more data you collect, the more confident you can be in your conclusions.
